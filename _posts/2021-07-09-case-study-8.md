## Introduction

Danny created Fresh Segments, a digital marketing agency that helps other businesses analyse trends in online ad click behaviour for their unique customer base.

Clients share their customer lists with the Fresh Segments team who then aggregate interest metrics and generate a single dataset worth of metrics for further analysis.

In particular - the composition and rankings for different interests are provided for each client showing the proportion of their customer list who interacted with online assets related to each interest for each month.

Danny has asked for your assistance to analyse aggregated metrics for an example client and provide some high level insights about the customer list and their interests.

## Available Data

For this case study there is a total of 2 datasets which you will need to use to solve the questions.

### Interest Metrics

This table contains information about aggregated interest metrics for a specific major client of Fresh Segments which makes up a large proportion of their customer base.

Each record in this table represents the performance of a specific `interest_id` based on the client's customer base interest measured through clicks and interactions with specific targeted advertising content.


<div class="responsive-table" markdown="block">

| _month | _year | month_year | interest_id | composition | index_value | ranking | percentile_ranking |
|------- | ----- | ---------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| 7      | 2018  | 07-2018    | 32486       | 11.89       | 6.19        | 1       | 99.86              |
| 7      | 2018  | 07-2018    | 6106        | 9.93        | 5.31        | 2       | 99.73              |
| 7      | 2018  | 07-2018    | 18923       | 10.85       | 5.29        | 3       | 99.59              |
| 7      | 2018  | 07-2018    | 6344        | 10.32       | 5.1         | 4       | 99.45              |
| 7      | 2018  | 07-2018    | 100         | 10.77       | 5.04        | 5       | 99.31              |
| 7      | 2018  | 07-2018    | 69          | 10.82       | 5.03        | 6       | 99.18              |
| 7      | 2018  | 07-2018    | 79          | 11.21       | 4.97        | 7       | 99.04              |
| 7      | 2018  | 07-2018    | 6111        | 10.71       | 4.83        | 8       | 98.9               |
| 7      | 2018  | 07-2018    | 6214        | 9.71        | 4.83        | 8       | 98.9               |
| 7      | 2018  | 07-2018    | 19422       | 10.11       | 4.81        | 10      | 98.63              |

</div>

For example - let's interpret the first row of the `interest_metrics` table together:

<div class="responsive-table" markdown="block">

| _month | _year | month_year | interest_id | composition | index_value | ranking | percentile_ranking |
|------- | ----- | ---------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| 7      | 2018  | 07-2018    | 32486       | 11.89       | 6.19        | 1       | 99.86              |

</div>

In July 2018, the `composition` metric is 11.89, meaning that 11.89% of the client's customer list interacted with the interest `interest_id = 32486` - we can link `interest_id` to a separate mapping table to find the segment name called "Vacation Rental Accommodation Researchers"

The `index_value` is 6.19, means that the `composition` value is 6.19x the average composition value for all Fresh Segments clients' customer for this particular interest in the month of July 2018.

The `ranking` and `percentage_ranking` relates to the order of `index_value` records in each month year.

### Interest Map

This mapping table links the `interest_id` with their relevant interest information. You will need to join this table onto the previous `interest_details` table to obtain the `interest_name` as well as any details about the summary information.

<div class="responsive-table" markdown="block">

| id |       interest_name       |                                  interest_summary                                  |     created_at      |    last_modified    |

## Case Study Questions

The following questions can be considered key business questions that are required to be answered for the Fresh Segments team.

Most questions can be answered using a single query however some questions are more open ended and require additional thought and not just a coded solution!

### Data Exploration and Cleansing

1. Update the `fresh_segments.interest_metrics` table by modifying the `month_year` column to be a date data type with the start of the month
2. What is count of records in the `fresh_segments.interest_metrics` for each `month_year` value sorted in chronological order (earliest to latest) with the null values appearing first?
3. What do you think we should do with these null values in the `fresh_segments.interest_metrics`
4. How many `interest_id` values exist in the `fresh_segments.interest_metrics` table but not in the `fresh_segments.interest_map` table? What about the other way around?
5. Summarise the `id` values in the `fresh_segments.interest_map` by its total record count in this table
6. What sort of table join should we perform for our analysis and why? Check your logic by checking the rows where `interest_id = 21246` in your joined output and include all columns from `fresh_segments.interest_metrics` and all columns from `fresh_segments.interest_map` except from the `id` column.
7. Are there any records in your joined table where the `month_year` value is before the `created_at` value from the `fresh_segments.interest_map` table? Do you think these values are valid and why?

### Interest Analysis

1. Which interests have been present in all `month_year` dates in our dataset?
2. Using this same `total_months` measure - calculate the cumulative percentage of all records starting at 14 months - which `total_months` value passes the 90% cumulative percentage value?
3. If we were to remove all `interest_id` values which are lower than the `total_months` value we found in the previous question - how many total data points would we be removing?
4. Does this decision make sense to remove these data points from a business perspective? Use an example where there are all 14 months present to a removed `interest` example for your arguments - think about what it means to have less months present from a segment perspective.
5. After removing these interests - how many unique interests are there for each month?

### Segment Analysis

1. Using our filtered dataset by removing the interests with less than 6 months worth of data, which are the top 10 and bottom 10 interests which have the largest composition values in any `month_year`? Only use the maximum composition value for each interest but you must keep the corresponding `month_year`
2. Which 5 interests had the lowest average `ranking` value?
3. Which 5 interests had the largest standard deviation in their `percentile_ranking` value?
4. For the 5 interests found in the previous question - what was minimum and maximum `percentile_ranking` values for each interest and its corresponding `year_month` value? Can you describe what is happening for these 5 interests?
5. How would you describe our customers in this segment based off their composition and ranking values? What sort of products or services should we show to these customers and what should we avoid?

### Index Analysis

The `index_value` is a measure which can be used to reverse calculate the average composition for Fresh Segments' clients.

Average composition can be calculated by dividing the `composition` column by the `index_value` column rounded to 2 decimal places.

1. What is the top 10 interests by the average composition for each month?
2. For all of these top 10 interests - which interest appears the most often?
3. What is the average of the average composition for the top 10 interests for each month?
4. What is the 3 month rolling average of the max average composition value from September 2018 to August 2019 and include the previous top ranking interests in the same output shown below.
5. Provide a possible reason why the max average composition might change from month to month? Could it signal something is not quite right with the overall business model for Fresh Segments?

Required output for question 4:

<div class="responsive-table" markdown="block">

| month_year |         interest_name         | max_index_composition | 3_month_moving_avg |            1_month_ago            |           2_months_ago            |

## Conclusion

You have probably come across this concept of customer segments or marketing segments in your everyday life, maybe without you even noticing it!

Segments or audiences are super popular in the digital marketing space and using these interests or traits of customers is a mainstay of massive businesses like Google, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and other social media where there are targeted advertising.

Traditional businesses such as this client for Fresh Segments usually upload their customer emails or matched cookies into various digital marketing systems in order to generate some sort of match, usually using some machine learning methods, to other similar customers with the same interests.

Hopefully this case study helps you think about how these index metrics and compositions can be used for digital marketing!
